**** v1.04

Features:
- Mask files support (A mask file contains 32 bytes, where each bit
  represents a 256 bytes block from the APU memory. This is useful
  to speed up loading. They can be generated automatically with vspcplay:
  http://vspcplay.raphnet.net or manually.)

Code changes/clean ups:
- Better error handling (some place ignored errors).
- Fixed a bug on platforms with ppdev only (io was not initialised)
- Some messages only appear in verbose mode now. Added more verbose
  messages.

**** v1.03
Features:
- Added a configure script
- Linux ppdev support (enabled if configure detects linux/ppdev.h and
  linux/parport.h)
- Added -d to enable debug messages
- Status line is now enabled by default, -s disables it.
- Added djgpp makefile and config.h in the dos/ subdirectory
- Added xmms support (ppdev only)
- Added color to the command line interface (Linux only)
- The code is now clealy licensed as GPL

Code changes/clean ups:
- Operations done with apu are all in apu.c, and begins with apu_*
- IO function to control apu (read/write/reset/init) are now provided 
  to apu.c by the means of struct of function pointers.
- Added a new apuplay algorithm (see apuplay_embedded.c) designed for
  small embedded systems. It uses around 103 bytes of stack memory 
  (used more than 64k with the original algorithm). It is provided
  mostly for reference, there is no point to use it on a PC.

**** v1.02 (Sun Mar 6, 2005):
- Added support for DJGPP.

**** v1.01 (Sat Mar 5, 2005):
- Changed hardcoded offsets in arrays by meaningful names and added
comments about what is done. It is way easier to understand the code.

**** v1.0 (Thu Nov 25, 2004): Initial release
