- How To Compile

First, do a './configure'.

The ppdev support will be enabled if the
correct header files are detected. The same thing
applies to the direct io method.

To build the command line version, type 'make'.

To build the xmms plugin, type 'make xmms'. 

To install the xmms plugin, copy the hwapu.so file
into ~/.xmms/Plugins/Input or for global installation,
copy the file into the directory returned by 'xmms-config --plugin-dir'
